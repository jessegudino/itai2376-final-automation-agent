# Final Project: Process Automation Agent
**Student:** Jesus Gudino  
**Course:** ITAI 2376 - Deep Learning  
**Instructor:** Prof. Anna Devarakonda  

## 📌 Project Description
This project simulates a process automation agent using Python. It generates and sends an email using a simple function and logs the timestamp when the email is sent. It demonstrates automation logic and datetime tracking using only Python.

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Defines sender, recipient, subject, and message
- Creates the email body using Python
- Simulates sending an email
- Records and prints the time it was sent

## ✅ Output Sample
- Message "Email Sent (Simulated)" is displayed in Colab
- Shows email details: sender, recipient, subject, and body
- Logs the send time using `datetime.now()`

## 💻 How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook
2. Click **Runtime > Run all**
3. Watch the output and email log simulate in the cells

## 📝 Notes
- No API keys or external credentials are required
- Gmail sending is simulated, not actually transmitted
